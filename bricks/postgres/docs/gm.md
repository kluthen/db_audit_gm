# PostgreSQL brick — GM notes

Operating notes and internals of the `postgres` brick (`brick.yaml`,
master spec 9.1). Never shipped to players. Initial version (v0.1),
expected to evolve as games are played.

## Image

- Debian 13 (`debian:13-slim`), PostgreSQL 18 server and client from the
  PGDG repository (`trixie-pgdg`, major version pinned by package name),
  `openssh-server`, `sudo`, `nano`, `vim-tiny`, `less`, `procps`.
- s6-overlay 3.2.3.2 (x86_64), archives verified by SHA-256 at build.
- Build: `docker build -t 127.0.0.1:5000/dbagm/postgres:0.1.0 bricks/postgres`.
  Deploy with `docker stack deploy --resolve-image never`.
- Generic: no scenario content and no host keys in the image.

## Start-up (`gm-entrypoint`, every container start)

1. Empties `/run` and recreates `/run/postgresql` (`postgres`, `2775`),
   `/run/sshd`, `/run/sshd-keys`, `/run/gm`, `/run/tmp` (`/tmp` and
   `/var/tmp` are symlinks to it).
2. Generates an ed25519 sshd host key in `/run/sshd-keys`.
3. Fails the container if a secret is missing or empty.
4. If `/var/lib/gm-state/.gm-seeded` is absent: copies the seed files into
   `/etc/postgresql/` and writes the marker. A missing seed file fails the
   container. Never overwrites afterwards. The marker is on its own
   root-owned volume, out of reach of `player` and `postgres`: the
   configuration directory is group-writable without the sticky bit, so
   that editors saving by rename (`sed -i`) work, and a marker there could
   be removed.
5. If PGDATA is empty: `initdb` (UTF8, `C.UTF-8`, data checksums on by
   default in 18), then creates the role `dba` (`LOGIN SUPERUSER`, password
   from the secret) in single-user mode, and removes initdb's own
   `postgresql.conf` and `pg_hba.conf` from PGDATA, so the live files are
   only in `/etc/postgresql`. `pg_ident.conf` stays in PGDATA.
6. Writes `/home/player/.pgpass` (`*:*:*:dba:<password>`, `0600`).
7. Execs s6-overlay's `/init`, which supervises `postgres` and `sshd`.

PostgreSQL runs as
`postgres -D /var/lib/postgresql/18/data -c config_file=/etc/postgresql/postgresql.conf -c hba_file=/etc/postgresql/pg_hba.conf`.
Its stderr goes to the container's output (`gmctl logs`); players do not
see it.

### Why `/run` is a volume

A stack file's tmpfs mount is `noexec`, and the stack loader drops the
`exec` option and `mode`. s6-overlay refuses a `noexec` `/run`:

```
preinit: warning: your container manager pre-mounts run with the incorrect noexec option, which s6-overlay cannot work with
stage0: 83: exec: /run/s6/basedir/bin/init: Permission denied
```

(seen with s6-overlay 3.2.3.2 on Docker 29.8.2, task exit 126). The only
run-time fix it offers is `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`. So `/run` is the named volume
`run` (fallback (a) of the build plan's chunk 2), and the entrypoint
empties it before `/init`, so nothing survives from one container to the
next. The root filesystem stays read-only.

## What the seed files must contain

The scenario's seed files replace PostgreSQL's defaults entirely:

- `postgresql.conf`: `listen_addresses = '*'` (otherwise the bastion
  cannot connect), `port = 5432` (the health check, the wrappers and the
  validator use 5432), and whatever initdb would have set that the scenario
  cares about (`dynamic_shared_memory_type`, `timezone`, `lc_messages`...).
  Do not set `config_file`, `hba_file` or `data_directory`.
- `pg_hba.conf`: the line `local all postgres peer`, before any other line
  matching `postgres` on the local socket, with a comment marking it
  DO NOT TAMPER; plus the players' access for `dba`, for example
  `local all all scram-sha-256` and `host all all 0.0.0.0/0 scram-sha-256`
  (the password is SCRAM-hashed).
- Every knob should be inside its envelope unless an out-of-envelope value
  is a planted finding. A knob the seed does not set takes PostgreSQL's
  default, which the validator checks too.

## Accounts and access

- `player`: SSH by public key only (`AuthorizedKeysFile` points at the
  secret; no password, no PAM), member of `pgconf`. sshd sets
  `PGUSER=dba` and `PGDATABASE=postgres`. No TCP, agent or X11 forwarding.
- `dba`: superuser role, password from the secret `dba_password` (the same
  Swarm secret as the bastion's). Superuser also means OS access as
  `postgres`; protected files are root-owned and read-only, so it cannot
  alter them.
- `postgres`: the GM's account, over the local socket with peer
  authentication (`gmctl exec` as `postgres`, or `runuser -u postgres`).
  Sealed checks query as `postgres`.
- `sudo`: `player` may run the three wrappers as root, with no arguments
  (`/etc/sudoers.d/gm-player`): `env_reset`, fixed `secure_path`, no
  syslog, log in `/run/gm/sudo.log`.

## Wrappers

- `gm-reload-db`: `pg_ctl reload` as `postgres`, then lists
  `pg_file_settings` and `pg_hba_file_rules` errors (including "needs a
  restart"). Exit 1 only if PostgreSQL is not running.
- `gm-restart-db`: checks `postgres -C data_directory` with the live files
  and `pg_hba_file_rules`; refuses (exit 1) if either fails. Otherwise
  `s6-svc -r` (down signal `SIGINT`, fast shutdown) and waits up to 60 s
  for a new postmaster to accept connections. The container and SSH
  sessions survive. Failures that only show at start (shared memory too
  large for the memory limit, for example) are reported as "did not come
  back"; the reason is in `gmctl logs`.
- `gm-validate`: runs the validator as `postgres`, exit code passed
  through.

## Validator

`/opt/gm/validator/validate.sh [envelope-file]`, run as `postgres`. The
official run is `gmctl validate` (the GM's exec as `postgres`).

Envelope file format (capture W1-B), one rule a line, `#` comments:

```
shared_buffers  range 64MB 256MB    # bounds as PostgreSQL accepts them, - for unbounded
autovacuum      enum on             # allowed values, comma-separated, no spaces
wal_level       enum replica,logical
```

Values are compared in the setting's base unit: memory through
`pg_size_bytes`, time through `interval`, bare numbers as the base unit
(`shared_buffers = 16384` is 16384 blocks of 8kB); booleans as `on`/`off`;
enums case-insensitively. Both the value in effect (`pg_settings`) and the
pending value (the last `pg_file_settings` entry for the setting, which a
reload or restart would apply, `postgresql.auto.conf` included) are
checked. A setting no file sets has no pending value.

Output: `GREEN: ...` and exit 0; one `RED <rule>: ...` line per broken
rule and exit 1, for example

```
RED work_mem: in effect 128MB; pending 128MB (/etc/postgresql/postgresql.conf:18); envelope 1MB..64MB
RED max_connections: pending 300 (/etc/postgresql/postgresql.conf:4); envelope 10..200
RED pg_hba: the GM's line 'local all postgres peer' is missing from /etc/postgresql/pg_hba.conf (DO NOT TAMPER)
RED server: postgres cannot connect over the local socket (...)
```

`ERROR: ...` and exit 2 for a missing or malformed envelope file, an
unknown setting, a bound that is not a valid value, or an unexpected query
failure. If `postgres` cannot connect (GM line removed, server down), the
knob rules are reported red as not checked.

## Health check

Healthy while `sshd` is up, once PostgreSQL has accepted connections at
least once in this container (marker `/run/gm/postgres-was-ready`). After
that, PostgreSQL being down does not make the container unhealthy: a
player's broken configuration is the game's business, and Swarm replacing
the container would cut the players' SSH sessions. `gmctl deploy` waiting
for health therefore waits for the first PostgreSQL start.

## Capabilities

`cap_drop: ALL`, then the list in `brick.yaml`, checked by dropping each
one in turn (Docker 29.8.2): without `CHOWN`, `DAC_OVERRIDE`, `FOWNER`,
`SETGID` or `SETUID` the entrypoint fails; without `SYS_CHROOT` SSH
logins fail (privilege separation); without `KILL` `gm-restart-db`
cannot restart PostgreSQL; without `AUDIT_WRITE` every `sudo` prints
"unable to send audit message". `NET_BIND_SERVICE` is not needed under
Docker, which sets `net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=0`, but sshd
binds port 22, so it stays for other platforms. `no-new-privileges` is
off: `sudo` is setuid.

## Known limits (v0.1)

- **Host key per container.** The sshd host key is generated at each
  container start. If the container is replaced, players see a changed
  host key on the inner hop.
- **`.pgpass` is rewritten** at each container start from the secret.
- **Server log** only in the container output; players see it only if a
  scenario turns `logging_collector` on.
- **Write policy**: only `fixable` in v0.1. A `report-only` node would need
  the configuration files not group-writable, decided at start from a
  value the renderer passes; not built.
- **Stop timing**: s6 gives services 8 s to stop, inside Docker's default
  10 s stop grace period.

## Stack test

`sh bricks/postgres/tests/run-stack-test.sh` deploys the brick as a
one-service stack (`tests/stack.test.yml`, test fixtures in
`tests/fixtures/`), checks the chunk's Done-when, and removes everything
it created, volumes included. Needs a swarm manager and the image built.
